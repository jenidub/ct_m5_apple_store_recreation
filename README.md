# Apple Store Recreation Project

## Overview

This project is a re-creation of the Apple Store website, designed as a responsive, interactive website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It emulates the design and user experience of the Apple Store, showcasing product categories, shopping assistance, and service options.

    -   Utilizes Bootstrap's `navbar` component with `navbar-expand-md` to support a toggle menu for smaller screens.
    -   Includes brand logo and navigation links styled for consistency with Apple’s design aesthetic.
2.  **Hero Section:**
    
    -   A visually appealing introduction to the store with a prominent call-to-action.

3.  **Product Gallery:**
    
    -   A gallery displaying product categories such as Mac, iPhone, iPad, and more.
    -   Includes tooltips powered by Bootstrap for additional product information.
4.  **Featured Products:**
    
    -   Highlights the latest Apple products using Bootstrap cards with overlay text for pricing and details.
5.  **Support Options:**
    
    -   Two interactive Bootstrap card elements for shopping and technical support, linked to corresponding forms.
    -   Forms include validation and provide visual feedback.
6.  **Price Range Table:**
    
    -   Displays product categories with pricing and stock status using Bootstrap's table component.
